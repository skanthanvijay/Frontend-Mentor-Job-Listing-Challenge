## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript with jQuery

### What I learned

I wrote a notepad to myself outlining the specific goals I had in mind for aspects of the code to test out or have finished, and also used it to assist in imagining the logic behind the code. This proved to be effective, and it made the code more organized and streamlined than in previous projects.

### Continued development

I only used jQuery for this project, and as such there are likely areas of the code I could have made more efficient, such as potentially having been able to use code from the JSON file directly rather than copying the JSON file into the JavaScript file. I would have used React for this project, however I still need to learn how to use it.
